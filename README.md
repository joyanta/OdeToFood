Scott Allen's Plural Sights ASP.NET Core 1.0 Fundamentals tutorial, all build with some changes (mainly referential).

He is one of the best teacher I found and I am happy that I finished this course.

His course gives you everything you need to know to start building your first ASP.NET Core application with the MVC framework.
